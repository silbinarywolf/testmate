## Contributing

## Rules

- Create a Github Issue first to define the problem, if possible, also give one or more possible approaches to solving the problem.

## How to develop and test

1) Run `yarn build` from the main directory to compile all sub-packages. (This will take a while)

2) Run `yarn watch-example` from the main directory to run the `packages/example`. Which is a TypeScript Webpack project utilizing CSS Modules.
